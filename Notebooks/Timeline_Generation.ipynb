    "# Event-based Timeline Generation Tool for Document Analysis\n",
    "Addressing the critical need within the legal profession, this project aims to develop a solution for efficiently analyzing vast volumes of legal documents. Lawyers often spend weeks aggregating evidence from numerous submissions to construct a chronological timeline of events relevant to a case, and in some cases, there can be thousands or even millions of documents to process. Hence, I propose developing a tool that will enable lawyers to upload case-related documents and get a chronological timeline of events related to the case, associating each event with its corresponding documents so they can easily refer to the source document. With the proposed tool, this time-consuming task will be streamlined into a fast and efficient process, analyzing documents within minutes instead of weeks. I believe this tool can be scaled to serve not only legal professionals but also various other fields that require efficient document analysis."

      "SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE \n",
      "6. The Claimant, along with its parent company, focuses on non-terrestrial communication \n",
      "technologies. It delivers affordable internet access globally and especially targets unserved and \n",
      "underserved \n",
      "populations \n",
      "in \n",
      "rural \n",
      "and \n",
      "remote \n",

      "Leveraging \n",
      "cutting-edge \n",
      "40 \n",
      "telecommunications technology, Astracommex Global has pioneered the revolutionary \n",
      "concept of a low-Earth-orbit (“LEO”) satellite mega-constellation. This concept involves \n",
      "deploying a vast network of 5,000 satellites across various altitudes - 400, 450, 500, and 600 \n",
      "kilometers above Earth - to establish a high-speed, high-quality, and cost-effective non-\n",
      "terrestrial communication network. A standout feature of this network is the utilization of inter-\n",
      "45 \n",
      "satellite optical links, enhancing speed and efficiency. \n",
      "7. The Claimant was attracted to Celestria primarily by its digitalization agenda. The Respondent \n",
      "has consistently affirmed its dedication to advancing digitalization projects in rural areas since \n",
      "2010. An example is the flagship digital health project which the Respondent promoted in 2015, \n",
      "creating a promising market for internet service providers like the Claimant.2 \n",
      "50 \n",
      "8. In 2016, the Respondent inaugurated the Rural Digitalization Fund (“RDF”) with a substantial \n",
      "grant of USD 1 billion, reiterating its commitment to narrowing the gap between rural and \n",
      "urban areas by ensuring universal access to internet communication services across its territory. \n",
      "The Respondent actively encouraged foreign investors, such as the Claimant, to invest in its \n",
      "territory. To that end, the Respondent invited bids from both foreign and domestic internet \n",
      "55 \n",
      "service providers for the allocation of the RDF funds and the necessary radio frequencies. \n",
      "9. On 15 February 2016, the Claimant submitted its application in the auction organized by the \n",
      "Respondent, presenting a LEO satellite mega-constellation (named the “Astra System”).3 The \n",
      "Claimant won the bid in August of thintoe same year.  \n",

      "10. The Respondent’s National Frequency Agency (“NFA”) and Rural Development Agency\n",
      "60 \n",
      "(“RDA”) subsequently entered into a contract with the Claimant on 1 October 2016 (the “RDF\n",

      "developing and installing the Astra satellites as well as the ground stations on the territory of\n",
      "the Respondent, in order to deliver the promised quality of internet services.\n",
      "65 \n",
      "11. However, in January 2020, following the change in the Respondent’s Government, the\n",
      "Respondent began to slowly backtrack on its commitments, taking a multitude of measures\n",
      "that ultimately stripped the Claimant of its investment.\n",
      "12. As a first step, the Respondent enacted the National Environmental Protection Act (the\n",
      "“NEPA”).5 The NEPA, despite stating that it would not apply retroactively, was interpreted\n",
      "70 \n",
      "broadly in practice in terms of what constitutes “future agency actions.” This interpretation\n",
      "opened the door to a series of wide-ranging measures against the Claimant that caused the\n",
      "Claimant’s eventual loss of all of its operations in relation to the territory of Celestria.\n",
      "13. On 1 June 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency established radio silence zones which de facto\n",
      "reduced the communication reach of the Astra System from covering 100% of Celestria’s\n",
      "75 \n",
      "territory to covering only 40%. Even though the Celestrian Space Agency relied on scant\n",
      "scientific evidence to make its decision, the Claimant cooperated in good faith and offered new\n",
      "plans to mitigate any potential impact on astronomy. The new plan obliged the Claimant to\n",
      "apply for a new Ku-band spectrum to operate. The Claimant was optimistic that the plan would\n",
      "be simple to execute because Article 6 of the RDF Agreement allows for the modification of\n",
      "80 \n",
      "support from the NFA and RDA under specific conditions.6\n",
      "14. However, during the NFA’s processing of the Claimant’s request for the new Ku-band\n",
      "frequencies, the NFA requested the Claimant to submit supplementary materials to facilitate\n",
      "an environmental impact assessment regarding the reentry of the satellites. The Claimant\n",
      "refused to submit further documents and such refusal resulted in a long silence from the NFA.\n",
      "85 \n",
      "The application was kept pending and was finally rejected on 15 December 2020.\n",

      "90 \n",
      "malfunction induced by an unusual solar radiation storm.7\n",
      "16. On 5 January 2021, the DoD initiated an investigation and suspended the Claimant’s operations\n",
      "on Celestria’s territory.8\n",
      "17. On 1 March 2021, the DoD abruptly ordered the Claimant to reposition of all of its 400km\n",
      "altitude satellites to new orbits below 350km. To add salt to the injury, the DoD also ordered\n",
      "95 \n",
      "a continuing suspension of the Claimant’s operation on the territory of Celestria until the\n",
      "reposition was completed.9\n",
      "18. The orbits and plans of all the 5,000 satellites in the current Astra System were deliberately\n",
      "and carefully engineered. While the Claimant possesses the technical capacities to reposition\n",
      "of the 400km satellites, such action will cost the Claimant USD 1 billion. In addition, the\n",
      "100 \n",
      "Claimant will need an authorization from the NFA to use the new spectrums due to the adjusted\n",

      "1. The Republic of Celestria (“Celestria”), the Respondent in the present proceeding, hereby \n",

      "Claimant’s Request for Arbitration. 3. Unless otherwise stated, the Respondent disagrees with every statement made by the Claimant \n",
      "in the Request for Arbitration. \n",

      "TRIBUNAL \n",
      "LACKS \n",
      "JURISDICTION \n",
      "RATIONE \n",
      "TEMPORIS \n",
      "TO \n",
      "ENTERTAIN THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIM \n",
      "4. The Respondent considers that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over the dispute.\n",
      "5. Article 2 of the BIT defines its scope and provides that “[t]his Agreement shall apply to legal \n",
      "disputes in relation to investments that existed at the time of entry into force as well as to \n",
      "investments made or acquired thereafter.” 6. Article 2 of the BIT is silent on whether it applies to disputes that existed prior to its entry into \n",
      "force. Therefore, the Tribunal should apply general international law and notably Article 28 of \n",
      "the Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties which entered into force on 27 January 1980 \n",
      "(“VCLT”) and provides that: \n",
      "Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its \n",
      "provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation \n",
      "which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to \n",
      "that party. 7. In the case at hand, the intention of the BIT’s contracting parties was to exclude disputes that \n",
      "arose prior to its entry into force, as the contracting parties made clear in a binding interpretive \n",
      "statement that they issued on 10 October 2022.  \n",
      "8.\n",
      "Furthermore, the dispute between the Parties arose and crystallized prior to the entry into force \n",
      "of the BIT for several reasons. \n",
      "9. First, the root of the dispute between the Parties is the denial by Astracommex Regional of\n",
      "Celestria’s right to adopt environmental regulations as shown by the comments of its CEO on\n",
      "the date of the adoption of the NEPA.\n",
      "10. Second, on 15 October 2020, faced with the request by the NFA to produce additional materials\n",
      "concerning the atmospheric impact of Astra satellite reentries, Astracommex Regional sent a\n",
      "letter to the NFA contesting such request and declining to “provide additional materials.” Astracommex Regional thus disregarded a request made by an agency of Celestria.\n",
      "11. Third, most of the factual matrix on which the Claimant is relying upon in the Request occurred\n",
      "prior to the entry into force of the BIT.\n",
      "12. Accordingly, the Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to declare that it lacks\n",
      "jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims against the Respondent.\n",
      "III. THE RESPONDENT’S MEASURES DO NOT AMOUNT TO EXPROPRIATION\n",
      "13. If the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection, the Respondent affirms\n",
      "that it respected at all times its treaty obligations towards the Claimant. The Respondent\n",
      "undertook regulatory and administrative measures within its power for the safety and well-\n",
      "being of its citizens and the environment. None of the Respondent’s actions constitutes\n",
      "expropriation under Article VII of the BIT.\n",
      "14. First, the Claimant retains the ownership, operation, and control over all its satellites and\n",
      "continues to provide services on territories other than that of the Respondent, for instance in\n",
      "the Kingdom of Nebuland. As such, the Respondent opposes the Claimant’s conclusion that it\n",
      "had suffered any deprivation of its property rights, not to mention a “significant deprivation.”\n",
      "15.\n",
      "Moreover, the Claimant’s assertions as to the permanent nature of the suspension of the\n",
      "Claimant’s satellite communications within Celestria’s territory are also unfounded. The\n",
      "Claimant’s operations are suspended only until the Claimant successfully repositions the\n",
      "400km satellites, of which, as the Claimant itself submitted, the satellites are more than\n",
      "capable. It is thus by the Claimant’s own choice that its operations remain suspended. The \n",
      "suspension cannot be deemed permanent in nature.\n",
      "16. Lastly, out of abundance of caution, the Respondent notes that Celestria has made the following\n",
      "notification under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention:\n",
      "Pursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention, the Republic of Celestria will only \n",
      "consider submitting disputes over expropriation and nationalization to the jurisdiction of \n",
      "the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n",
      "IV.\n",
      "IN ANY EVENT, THE MEASURES ARE JUSTIFIED UNDER THE APPLICABLE\n",
      "INTERNATIONAL LAW\n",
      "17. The regulatory actions from respectively the Celestrian Space Agency, the National Frequency\n",
      "Agency (“NFA”), and the Department of Defense (“DoD”) are justifiable and thus do not entail\n",
      "the international responsibility of the Respondent. 18. The Celestrian Space Agency’s action is a legitimate exercise of police power for public\n",
      "welfare. Optical and radio astronomy are important for the public not only for purposes of\n",
      "science, but also for preventing or mitigating catastrophic events like asteroid impact. As part\n",
      "of the UN-endorsed International Asteroid Warning Network (“IAWN”), the Celestrian Space\n",
      "Agency utilizes its ten major telescopes for discovering, monitoring, and physically\n",
      "characterizing the potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.\n",
      "19. The NFA’s decision was informed by evidence of atmospheric impacts gathered by the\n",
      "Celestria Institute of Technology, a laboratory sponsored by the Environmental Protection\n",
      "Agency (“EPA”). The NFA’s approach aligns with the precautionary principle enshrined in\n",
      "Article V of the BIT.\n",
      "The principle’s objective is to anticipate and avoid environmental damage\n",
      "before it occurs, in recognition of the need to protect human health and the environment by\n",
      "taking precautionary measures while scientific studies are undertaken to qualify the risk or\n",
      "risks associated with a course of action. The absence of evidence that mass scale satellite\n",
      "reentries would not negatively impact the stratosphere was sufficient to activate the principle. 20. The DoD’s measures address concerns about environmental impacts from space debris and\n",
      "national security, including potential collision with DoD’s military assets in adjacent orbits. The DoD investigation revealed both software and hardware flaws in the Claimant’s system,\n",
      "threatening Celestria’s essential security.\n",
      "The Claimant asserted that the DoD decision was\n",
      "“outside of Celestria’s jurisdiction.” However, the Respondent was not claiming jurisdiction\n",
      "over the Claimant’s satellites per se. Instead, it was regulating the use of outer space orbits,\n",
      "which are designated as global commons under Article I of the Outer Space Treaty:\n",
      "Outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be free for exploration and \n",

      "Dear Mr. Myskin,\n",
      "Based on the Department of Defense’s investigation of the AS100 satellite collision, we have identified both software and hardware deficiencies in the collision avoidance system of the Astra satellites. Regarding the software, the algorithm Astracommex used to predict relies predominantly on data collected by the Space Surveillance Network of Cosmosis. Since the cessation of Cosmosis-Celestria diplomatic relations, Celestria has shut down all of Cosmosis’ terrestrial radar operations within Celestria’s borders, coupled with subsequent national security regulations prohibiting sensitive data transfer to Cosmosis.\n",
      "These measures have significantly impacted Cosmosis’ Space Surveillance Network’s accuracy on Celestria related space activities. Regarding the hardware, we find that the onboard sensors of Astra satellites have an error rate from 5% to 10% in detecting and avoiding objects smaller than 20 centimeters approaching from certain angles. This flaw, as our investigation suggests, cannot be rectified with software updates as previously suggested by Astracommex. The heightened risks of collision in space, particularly due to the potential onset of Kessler Syndrome, significantly compromises the safety of Celestria’s space operations. The issue is especially pertinent for the Department of Defense’s assets operating in 400km altitude orbits, where the risk of satellite collisions presents a national security concern.\n",
      "Kessler Syndrome is a scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbits (LEO) due to space pollution is numerous enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions. Moreover, such collisions are a primary source of space debris, i.e., space junk. According to Articles I and II of the National Environmental Protection Act, it is mandatory for governmental agencies to consider the protection of the human environment, including outer space, in their decision-making processes. In light of these concerns and under the authority of the Celestria National Security Law and the National Environmental Protection Act, the Department of Defense hereby issues the following directives:\n",
      "i. Orbital Adjustments: All Astra satellites currently in 400km altitude orbits must be relocated to orbits below 350km. This includes repositioning 99 existing satellites (AS100 is not included) and coordinating with the Department of Defense for any future satellite launches adjacent to 400km orbits by Astracommex Regional in Celestria.\n",
      "ii. Suspension of Operations: All satellite communications within Celestria’s territory must be suspended by Astracommex Regional until the orbital adjustments are completed. Immediate adherence to these instructions is required. Failure to comply will result in legal consequences, including penalties and possible criminal charges. Astracommex has the right to appeal this decision in accordance with Celestria Administrative Law. Yours sincerely,\n",

(“Astracommex”), attaching the Privilege and Confidentiality Log, as well as the list of produced documents. Due to the size of the files, Celestria also attached a link to an external storage website, where the documents were available to download. Based on notification from the system, counsel for Astracommex logged in to the website at 8.53 pm and downloaded all documents.\n",

      "4. Upon review, counsel for Astracommex noticed that Celestria did not produce an AS100 collision incident report dated 17 February 2021 under Request No. 23. Counsel for Astracommex therefore immediately notified Celestria, expecting this to be a clerical or technical error. 5. Celestria responded by e-mail dated 16 June 2024. It stated that “after conducting reasonable\n",

      "The\n",
      "heavily redacted version shows that the document is responsive under the Request No. 23.\n",

      "thus in possession of Celestria.\n",
      "7. Based on the available unredacted information, the governmental cubesat involved in the\n",

      "cubesat being developed as part of an advanced anti-satellite weapon system, in collaboration\n",
      "with the Celestrian DoD. The document also suggested that the AS100 was mistakenly\n",
      "identified as its target. Consequently, this document appears to implicate Valinor as the cause\n",
      "of the collision, significantly jeopardizing Celestria’s position in this arbitration. Given the\n",

      "Exhibit R-5: Scientists’ Call to Halt Satellite Light Pollution\n",
      "Astra Nature Astronomy26 Comment | Published: 30 May 2020 A call for scientists to halt the spoiling of the night sky with artificial light and satellites\n",
      "By Amateur Astronomy Association The availability of clear night sky viewing is quickly dwindling as a result of artificial light and the tracking of constellations by satellites. Scientists need to take a stronger stance against “big light” and “big space” in order to protect this natural resource. Light pollution, produced both at Earth’s surface and from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, is rapidly increasing. Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an anthropogenic pollutant, as defined since 1979 by the United Nations: “[a]ir pollution means the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the air resulting in deleterious effects of such a nature as to endanger human health, harm living resources and ecosystems and material property and impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment, and ‘air pollutants’ shall be construed accordingly,” where “energy is understood to include heat, light, noise and radioactivity introduced and released into the atmosphere through human activities.”\n",
      "Reading the recent reports on light pollution by LEO satellites including the recent one by Celestrian Space Agency, we are very pessimistic about the path being followed by an important part of the scientific community (and other actors) that works on and has responsibilities for these areas of research. This situation echoes historical patterns seen in various fields, from tobacco smoke to climate change, diesel emissions, asbestos, and opioids. In these instances, whenever scientific literature begins addressing a health or environmental issue, those responsible often deploy a “machine of doubt” to delay, or even halt, the implementation of necessary countermeasures and regulations. \n",
      "26 Astronomy Association is a peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the Astra Nature Publishing Group. It focuses on all aspects of astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science. As a part of the prestigious “Astra Nature” family of journals, it is known for its high impact and rigorous peer-review process, aiming to publish the most significant and cutting-edge research in these fields.\n",
      "27 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (United Nations, 1996). 28 Celestrian Space Agency, Impact of the Astracommex Astra Satellites on Optical and Radio Observatories in Celestria, THE CELESTRIA JOURNAL OF ASTROPHYSICS, 20 May 2020. R-5\n",
      "This strategy is alarmingly consistent: polluters deny evidence, fund contrary research, and procrastinate on pollution limits, leading to millions of deaths and an over-polluted world. Now, as we face the challenges posed by “big space,” one must question if their tactics will differ from those of “big oil,” “big tobacco,” or “big pharma.” The current approach to the problem of LEO satellites — trying to mitigate their impact by dimming their brightness, adjusting telescope operations, or avoiding their paths — is insufficient and does not address the full scope of the issue. If unchecked, the proliferation of satellites will drastically change our night skies, with hundreds or thousands visible at any given moment, obscuring the view that has been a human heritage for millennia.\n",
      "We thus call on all relevant actors to rebuild international cooperation and agreement in order to avoid escalation. It’s particularly crucial for governments to not be swayed or hindered by the so-called “machine of doubt.” They possess a potent instrument through Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration: In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. \n",

      "2 January 2021 Breaking: Unfortunate Collision, the Wandering AS100\n",
      "On 1 January 2021, one of Astracommex’s satellites, AS100 collided with a cubesat operated by Valinor. The Valinor cubesat involved is said to be a component of a trial missile defense system that Valinor developed in partnership with the Department of Defense of Celestria. The payload of the Valinor cubesat includes the state-of-art Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor. It is designed to identify and track hypersonic and ballistic missile threats and provide critical data to the Department of Defense’s Missile Defense System and the warfighter. The Celestrian Department of Defense is believed to have launched this system as a covert operation in response to diplomatic tensions with Cosmosis in 2017. According to insiders at the Department of Defense, this strategic move was intended to strengthen Celestria’s readiness for any potential future conflicts arising from regional tensions. This was especially important given Cosmosis’ regional dominance in aerospace, space technology, and missile capabilities. Astracommex believes that the collision was not their fault. According to the company’s CEO, Jeffrey Myskin, “there was no close-proximity alert from the Space Surveillance Network, nor were there any public records of a cubesat operating in the same orbit.” He also urged the public not to lose faith in their collision avoidance system, claiming that “the last data recorded in our system prior to the collision indicates that high energy protons from the unusual solar radiation storm affected the onboard computation. Our patent products contain no inherent flaws but were affected by the unusually extreme solar radiation. Our software engineering team has been working right after the collision to update the onboard software for all the existing and upcoming satellites to protect them from interference by extreme space weather events.” Our Celestria Space Agency source confirmed observing a “unusually strong” solar flare at the time of collision. The CEO also urged Valinor to coordinate with Astracommex in post-collision self-assessment and future operations. He emphasized that proactive communication from Valinor could have prevented the incident and the collision. Valinor has so far not responded to a request for comment on the incident.\n",

Article 2 Authorization of Ka-band Frequencies 1. In consideration of the contents of Astracomnex Regional’s RDF Application, the NFA and RDA grant to Astracomnex Regional, to the extent set forth below, the rights to deploy a non-geostationary (“NGSO”) satellite system to provide service using certain Fixed-Satellite Service (“FSS”) and Mobile-Satellite Service (“MSS”) Ka-band frequencies with the conditions adopted herein. 2. Astracomnex Regional is authorized to operate its NGSO FSS system in the 17.7-20 GHz bands, and to provide MSS, in addition to FSS, in the 19.7-22 GHz bands. Astracomnex Regional is authorized to use the above Ka-band Frequencies with the conditions adopted herein, free of charge, for ten years. The rate of usage for the subsequent period will be renegotiated in due course. Article 3 Deployment Requirements 1. Astracomnex Regional commits to offer stand-alone broadband service at speeds consistent with the RDF Application, i.e., with at least 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream (25/3 Mbps) at rates reasonably comparable to those available in urban areas to all locations within an awarded area of the ten-year program. 2. The initial interim deployment milestones are set as follows. Astracomnex Regional as carrier must complete: i. 10 percent of deployments by the end of year one; ii. 30 percent of deployments by the end of year two; iii. 50 percent of deployments by the end of year three; iv. 70 percent of deployments by the end of year four; v. 100 percent of deployments by the end of year five. Article 4 Annual Filing Requirements Astracomnex Regional must fulfill its total build-out obligations over six years of the ten-year program and meet the interim service milestones. Astracomnex Regional is required to file and certify annually in the RDF portal all locations deployed to in the prior year and should be prepared to provide documentation to the compliance team to substantiate build-out. Article 5 Payment 1. The RDA will begin issuing annual payments to Astracomnex Regional shortly after the public notice has been released. While the payments under the RDF be disbursed over a period of 10 years, Astracomnex Regional must complete the deployment by the end of the fifth year to all locations in areas eligible for support and must meet interim deployment milestones along the way. 2. The payment will be divided into equal installments of USD 50,000,000 over the span of 10 years. Article 6 Reassessment A reassessment in year four of the program may revise deployment obligations and modify support from the NFA and RDA in certain circumstances. Article 7 Legal Consequences of Breach of Contract 1. If Astracomnex Regional breaches the Agreement, specifically regarding the obligations outlined in Article 3, the NFA and RDA shall be entitled to apply sanctions against Astracomnex Regional as stipulated in the present Agreement. 2. Astracomnex Regional agrees to pay a penalty to the NFA and RDA in the cases regulated in the present Agreement. In addition to claiming a penalty, the NFA and RDA shall be entitled to impose other sanctions against Astracomnex Regional. Should Astracomnex Regional breach the same regulation several times or continually, the penalty may be imposed several times. 3. The NFA and RDA are entitled to withhold the RDF payment in case of breach of Article 3 of the present Agreement. The parties have thoroughly read the present Agreement, discussed it with their legal representatives and caused this Agreement to be executed as evidence of their full consent thereto.

      "Today is a defining moment that could reshape regional relations. The Prime Minister of Cosmosis, Nigel Palpatinous, delivered a stark rebuke today of Celestria’s failure in handling climate change issues. He criticized the neighboring nation for its apparent inability to adequately protect its population from escalating threats posed by climate change. This, he suggested, not only compromises Celestria’s own stability but also poses a substantial setback to the collective global effort to address the climate crisis. Since the summer of 2013, Cosmosis, the only neighboring state that is connected to Celestria by land, has emerged as a major destination for Celestrians displaced by climate change. The once tranquil border area of Cosmosis is now grappling with safety concerns and resource strains caused by homeless migrants.\n",
      "The local government’s efforts, including an injection of over 100,000 USD dollars for additional police force and humanitarian assistance, have fallen short of addressing the escalating situation. A local villager, expressing their distress, said, “Why haven’t I left this village? I am poor! I am trapped here with these folks. And why should I leave? It makes absolutely no sense for Cosmosis taxpayers to pay for Celestria’s failure!” The situation reached a critical point following a devastating tropical storm in the summer of 2016, leading to an unprecedented surge in refugee numbers. In a decisive move, Prime Minister Palpatinous announced Cosmosis’ first-ever climate migration policy, denying asylum to Celestrian residents displaced by natural disasters and climate change effects. This publication echoes the sentiment that the Celestrian government must reassess its priorities and focus on proactive measures to protect its citizens against the changing climate.\n",

      "III. SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE \n",
      "6. The Claimant, along with its parent company, focuses on non-terrestrial communication technologies. It delivers affordable internet access globally and especially targets unserved and underserved populations in rural and remote areas. Leveraging cutting-edge telecommunications technology, Astracommex Global has pioneered the revolutionary concept of a low-Earth-orbit (“LEO”) satellite mega-constellation. This concept involves deploying a vast network of 5,000 satellites across various altitudes - 400, 450, 500, and 600 kilometers above Earth - to establish a high-speed, high-quality, and cost-effective non-terrestrial communication network. A standout feature of this network is the utilization of inter-satellite optical links, enhancing speed and efficiency. 7. The Claimant was attracted to Celestria primarily by its digitalization agenda. The Respondent has consistently affirmed its dedication to advancing digitalization projects in rural areas since 2010. An example is the flagship digital health project which the Respondent promoted in 2015, creating a promising market for internet service providers like the Claimant. 8. In 2016, the Respondent inaugurated the Rural Digitalization Fund (“RDF”) with a substantial grant of USD 1 billion, reiterating its commitment to narrowing the gap between rural and urban areas by ensuring universal access to internet communication services across its territory. The Respondent actively encouraged foreign investors, such as the Claimant, to invest in its territory. To that end, the Respondent invited bids from both foreign and domestic internet service providers for the allocation of the RDF funds and the necessary radio frequencies. 9. On 15 February 2016, the Claimant submitted its application in the auction organized by the Respondent, presenting a LEO satellite mega-constellation (named the “Astra System”). The Claimant won the bid in August of thintoe same year. 10. The Respondent’s National Frequency Agency (“NFA”) and Rural Development Agency (“RDA”) subsequently entered into a contract with the Claimant on 1 October 2016 (the “RDF Agreement”), providing the Claimant with USD 500 million and allocating the necessary Ka-band frequencies for a ten-year period. Since then, the Claimant has been conscientiously developing and installing the Astra satellites as well as the ground stations on the territory of the Respondent, in order to deliver the promised quality of internet services. 11. However, in January 2020, following the change in the Respondent’s Government, the Respondent began to slowly backtrack on its commitments, taking a multitude of measures that ultimately stripped the Claimant of its investment. 12. As a first step, the Respondent enacted the National Environmental Protection Act (the “NEPA”). The NEPA, despite stating that it would not apply retroactively, was interpreted broadly in practice in terms of what constitutes “future agency actions.” This interpretation opened the door to a series of wide-ranging measures against the Claimant that caused the Claimant’s eventual loss of all of its operations in relation to the territory of Celestria. 13. On 1 June 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency established radio silence zones which de facto reduced the communication reach of the Astra System from covering 100% of Celestria’s territory to covering only 40%. Even though the Celestrian Space Agency relied on scant scientific evidence to make its decision, the Claimant cooperated in good faith and offered new plans to mitigate any potential impact on astronomy. The new plan obliged the Claimant to apply for a new Ku-band spectrum to operate. The Claimant was optimistic that the plan would be simple to execute because Article 6 of the RDF Agreement allows for the modification of support from the NFA and RDA under specific conditions. 14. However, during the NFA’s processing of the Claimant’s request for the new Ku-band frequencies, the NFA requested the Claimant to submit supplementary materials to facilitate an environmental impact assessment regarding the reentry of the satellites. The Claimant refused to submit further documents and such refusal resulted in a long silence from the NFA. The application was kept pending and was finally rejected on 15 December 2020. 15. On 1 January 2021, an unfortunate collision happened between one of the Claimant’s satellites, AS100, and a cubesat owned by Valinor, a private company, and sponsored by the Respondent’s Department of Defense (“DoD”). Based on the Claimant’s engineers’ post-collision assessment of its proprietary software, the collision was due to an electronic malfunction induced by an unusual solar radiation storm. 16. On 5 January 2021, the DoD initiated an investigation and suspended the Claimant’s operations on Celestria’s territory. 17. On 1 March 2021, the DoD abruptly ordered the Claimant to reposition of all of its 400km altitude satellites to new orbits below 350km. To add salt to the injury, the DoD also ordered a continuing suspension of the Claimant’s operation on the territory of Celestria until the reposition was completed. 18. The orbits and plans of all the 5,000 satellites in the current Astra System were deliberately and carefully engineered. While the Claimant possesses the technical capacities to reposition of the 400km satellites, such action will cost the Claimant USD 1 billion. In addition, the Claimant will need an authorization from the NFA to use the new spectrums due to the adjusted configuration. The Claimant recalls, however, that the NFA rejected its request for Ku-band frequencies on 15 December 2020. Chances of the NFA accepting another request are slim. 19. Moreover, the Claimant’s 400km satellites were launched from the Kingdom of Cosmosis (“Cosmosis”) before the diplomatic relationship between the Respondent and Cosmosis broke down following the climate migration crisis. According to the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Registration Convention of 1974, Cosmosis has quasi-territorial jurisdiction over the 400km satellites. The Respondent thus has no authority to enforce such an order. 20. Due to the series of the Respondent’s measures, the Claimant’s business activities in Celestria have ceased entirely. Although the Claimant retains ownership of its assets, including the ground stations within the Respondent’s jurisdiction and the Astra satellites in outer space, it has been rendered incapable of conducting any business activities within the Respondent’s territory. The multi-agency actions amount to a comprehensive and permanent prohibition on the Claimant’s provision of internet services within the Respondent’s territory. 21. Consequently, the Respondent’s measures effectively deprived the Claimant of the enjoyment and operations of its investment, and clearly represent a breach of Article VII of the BIT. \n",
      "IV. JURISDICTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL\n",
      "A. Under the ICSID Convention\n",
      "22. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n",
      "The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n",
      "23. The Claimant satisfies the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. \n",
      "B. Under the BIT\n",
      "24. The Claimant equally meets the requirements of the BIT for the initiation of an ICSID arbitration. The Claimant recalls that prior to the entry into force of the BIT, Celestria and Nebuland were Contracting States to a Free Trade Agreement (the “FTA”) along with Cosmosis. The FTA was in force between 2003 and 2017. Following the termination of the FTA in 2017, Celestria and Nebuland negotiated, signed and ratified the BIT. 25. Article 2 of the BIT does not limit its temporal application. Article 2 is drafted in broad terms and provides that “[t]his Agreement shall apply to legal disputes in relation to investments that existed at the time of entry into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter.” Article 2 thus provides that the BIT applies to all legal disputes, as long as they relate to an investment.\n",
      "V. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL\n",
      "26. Pursuant to Article 11(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal is to be constituted in accordance with the method provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. 27. In accordance with Rule 16 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Claimant appoints Dr. Nika Havendale, a national of Gerheimburg, as its arbitrator. 28. Dr. Havendale’s contact information is the following: \n",

      "Email: nhavendale@havendale.com\n",
      "VI. REQUEST FOR RELIEF\n",
      "29. In light of the foregoing, Astracommex Regional requests that the Tribunal: \n",
      "i. DECLARE that the dispute is within the competence of the Centre and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; \n",
      "ii. DECLARE that Celestria has violated Article VII of the BIT; \n",
      "iii. ORDER Celestria to pay to the Claimant damages in an amount that will be determined later in the proceeding but in any event not inferior to USD 1,000,000,000; and \n",
      "iv. ORDER Celestria to bear the entire costs of the proceeding including the Claimant’s representation fees. \n",
      "30. Astracommex Regional respectfully requests the Secretary-General to register this Request for Arbitration against Celestria pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. For the Claimant, AstroJuris Arbitration\n",

      "I.\n",
      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "Astracommex Regional Satellite Communication Inc. (“Astracommex Regional”) operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary, with all of its shares held by its parent company, Astracommex Global Satellite Communication Inc. (“Astracommex Global”). Together, Astracommex Regional and Astracommex Global are collectively known as the Astracommex Group. The Astracommex Group specializes in delivering high-capacity, low-latency broadband communication services to unserved and underserved consumers and businesses in rural and remote areas globally through the deployment of low-Earth-orbit (“LEO”) constellation (the “Astra System”). The Astra System will comprise 5000 satellites at altitudes of 400, 450, 500, and 600 km.\n",
      "Astracommex Regional’s constellation plans to use frequencies in the Ka-band to provide Fixed-Satellite Services (“FSS”) and Mobile-Satellite Services (“MSS”) to customers. This innovative service is specifically suitable to address the distinct geographic challenges of Celestria. It focuses on delivering broadband to underserved rural areas, offering a more cost-effective alternative to terrestrial telecommunication networks. Moreover, it ensures heightened reliability and resilience against potential disruptions caused by events such as tsunamis, seabed earthquakes, which could otherwise sever internet connectivity throughout Celestria.\n",
      "The Astracommex Group harnesses robust innovation capabilities rooted in its expertise in space communication. With ownership of multiple patents, including those for small, cost-effective customer terminal antenna technology and an on-board autonomous collision avoidance system, the Astracommex Group is at the forefront of technological advancement.\n",
      "Demonstrating its commitment, the Astracommex Group has pledged a minimum investment of USD 3 billion to bolster the Astra System. Progressing steadily, the group aims to deliver affordable and dependable customer services. In April 2014, the Astracommex Group got authorization from Nebuland’s Bureau of Space Commerce to launch and operate TestSat1 and TestSat2 for testing and demonstration purposes. During test rounds, the satellites successfully communicated with Telemetry, Tracking & Command earth stations in the Astral Region, Asia, Africa, Australia, and North America, South America, and Europe as well as with customer terminal units and a single gateway earth station located in Nebuland. The test has fully validated the design of the Astra System and its capability for future commercial deployment. The Astracommex Group received authorization from Nebuland to operate in Ka-band on Nebuland territory in August 2014.\n",
      "The Astracommex Group maintains a forward-thinking approach. In October 2014, the Group announced a strategic agreement with the Cosmosis Space Agency to secure 30 Cosmo-9 launch vehicles further fortifying its deployment schedule. Notably, each Cosmo-9 launch vehicle possesses the capacity to deploy 50 Astra satellites. The Astracommex Group is actively developing the Astra System at its state-of-the-art, 300,000-square-foot facility in Nebuland, serving as the primary prototype and qualification facility. The project involves a dedicated team of over 700 employees, and the workforce is rapidly expanding.\n",
      "II.\n",
      "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION\n",
      "A.\n",
      "Space Segment\n",
      "• Laser Transmitters\n",
      "Each satellite is equipped with transmitters that enable direct laser transmissions with adjacent satellites. The primary function of laser transmitters is to establish inter-satellite links. These links allow satellites to communicate directly with each other in orbit, which is crucial for minimizing network latency. The orbit and relative position of Astra satellites are carefully engineered to ensure reliable data flow among the high-velocity satellites. Notably, the laser wavelength utilized by the Astra satellites is distinct from the wavelengths observable by optical telescopes, thereby mitigating the risk of interference with astronomical observations.\n",
      "• Autonomous Collision Avoidance System\n",
      "Each Astra satellite is equipped with our patented autonomous collision avoidance system to avoid collision in orbit with another satellite or other space debris. This system harnesses tracking data from both onboard sensors and data shared via the Space Surveillance Network (“SSN”). The SSN is organized by the Department of Defense of the Kingdom of Cosmosis and is renowned for its comprehensive coverage in tracking objects in orbit around the Earth. The collision avoidance system operates in real-time, constantly assessing the likelihood of collisions and making split-second decisions to alter the satellite’s course when necessary. Every Astra satellite is equipped with cutting-edge ion thrusters powered by krypton. These thrusters allow Astra satellites to change their orbits when the onboard computer determines that a maneuver is necessary to avoid a potential collision. The Astracommex Group retains the capability to remotely update the software of the collision avoidance system, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptability to the new challenges in space traffic management.\n",
      "B.\n",
      "Ground Segment\n",
      "The Astra System plans to have around 50 to 100 gateways on the territory of Celestria for its service provision to the Celestrian people.\n",
      "III.\n",
      "POST-MISSION DISPOSAL\n",
      "We believe the best option for post-mission disposal for satellites (as well as deorbiting dysfunctional satellites) is atmospheric reentry. Astra satellites, composed of various materials including aluminum alloys, are fully demisable. This approach to atmospheric reentry with fully-demisable satellites is preferred over leaving satellites in orbit or constructing them from materials that could survive reentry, posing a risk of human casualties.\n",

      "Solar Radiation Storm Four Times Earth’s Size Recorded by \n",
      "Amateur Astronomer in Celestria By Lucy Franks 5 Jan 2021 \n",
      "An amateur astronomer and Celestrian educational YouTuber named Rick Carrington captured a solar storm emerging away from the Sun where “four entire Earths” could fit in. Solar radiation storms happen when a massive magnetic explosion, typically triggering a coronal mass ejection and a related solar flare, speeds up charged particles in the sun’s atmosphere to extremely high speeds. The key particles in these events are protons, which can reach speeds close to that of light. These high-energy protons, when they hit satellites or humans in space, can deeply penetrate the impacted objects, potentially harming electronic components or biological DNA. AS100 collision was said to be caused by the solar storm observed this week.\n",
      "In the past few months, there’s been a rise in solar activity on the sun, the sole star of our solar system, as part of the ongoing Solar Cycle. While solar storms are a regular occurrence, their observation and recording hold great scientific value. \n",
      "Solar Storm Video \n",
      "Carrington detected the unusual space storm on a video posted on Instagram on 1 January 2021. In the caption, the amateur astronomer stated he was not expecting to capture the event, which happened after he pointed out his telescope on 30 December 2020. In the video, it can be noticed the Sun emitted a curve-shaped plasma out of its surface. The video has gained thousands of views and even caught the attention of Celestrian Space Agency. Rick Carrington is reportedly well recognized for uploading videos in matters relating to astronomy, astrophotography, telescopes and cameras. Note: CET refers to “Celestrian Eastern Time.” C-7\n",

      "STATEMENT OF UNCONTESTED FACTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The present proceeding results from a series of measures taken by several agencies of the Republic of Celestria (“Celestria”) that allegedly affect the operation of Astracommex Regional Satellite Communication Inc. (“Astracommex Regional”) on the territory of Celestria. Celestria is a middle-income island nation with one principal island, twelve medium-sized islands, and seventy-three smaller isles. Around sixty percent of its population resides in rural and isolated areas. The nation’s key economic sectors include traditional manufacturing, agriculture, and fishing. Operating under a presidential system, Celestria elects its president every five years by direct popular vote. In the 2010 election, the leader of the Celestria Unity Alliance (“CUA”), Mr. Andreas Skydocker, secured the presidency. The primary agenda of his party focused on boosting the economy through digitalization and channeling both public and private investments towards the development of digital infrastructures. Celestria is located in the Astral Archipelago Region. It shares a land border with the Kingdom of Cosmosis (“Cosmosis”) and is encircled by other states, including the Kingdom of Nebuland (“Nebuland”), from which it is separated by sea. Cosmosis is a developed state renowned for its globally dominant aerospace and space sector. Cosmosis owns an overseas space center in the equatorial region as one of its major research and launching sites. Nebuland is a developed State with an advanced tech industry, characterized by its robust ecosystem of start-ups, established tech giants, and research institutions. Celestria, Nebuland, and Cosmosis were parties to a Free Trade Agreement (the “FTA”) that entered into force on 2 December 2003. Astracommex Regional is a corporation established in 2015 under the laws of Nebuland with its principal place of business in Stelaria, the capital of Nebuland. Astracommex Regional operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary with all of its shares held by its parent company, Astracommex Global Satellite Communication Inc. (“Astracommex Global”), which is also organized under the laws of Nebuland. Astracommex Regional was established with the aim of managing and overseeing the operations in the Astral Archipelago Region’s nations outside of Nebuland. Mr. Jeffrey Myskin, the CEO of both Astracommex Regional and Astracommex Global, holds a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Nebuland Institute of Technology. Following his graduation, he and his university friends started a space lab in 2008 where they innovated and patented several space telecommunication technologies including advanced transmitters and antennas. The team’s effort led to the founding of Astracommex Global in 2011, with the ambition to create a global high-speed, high-quality, and affordable space communication network. The network aims to provide internet connectivity in areas typically unserved or underserved by traditional terrestrial infrastructure, such as rural regions, remote islands, ships, and aircraft. In the summer of 2014, Astracommex Global introduced its groundbreaking low-Earth-orbit (“LEO”) satellite mega-constellation concept and swiftly gathered significant venture capital investments from Marcial Ventures Ltd (“Marcial”) and Platonial Investments (“Platonial”). Marcial and Platonial together hold a 25% equity stake in Astracommex Global. Concurrently, under the leadership of President Skydocker, Celestria was vigorously advancing its digitalization initiatives. A notable step in this direction was Celestria’s application to the regional development bank on 1 January 2015, for funding of a digital health project, which received approval on 1 June 2015. The Digital Health Project aimed to create an integrated digital health information system across Celestria. Its primary goal was to bridge the information gaps between medical institutions on the various islands, thereby enhancing the quality of medical services available to the Celestrian population. The Project also involved collaboration with private sector companies for software provision, network connectivity, and other technical support, stimulating economic growth. The health data collected in the Digital Health Project, with the consent of individual patients, was set to be utilized by partnering pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers. The Project was promoted by the Skydocker administration as a prime example of how digital infrastructure can facilitate the growth of the national economy as a whole. On 1 January 2016, Celestria launched a Rural Digitalization Fund (the “RDF”). The primary aim of the RDF was to bridge the digital divide in Celestria, ensuring that communities and small businesses in rural areas had access to the same quality of internet communication services as urban areas. Celestria allocated to the RDF an amount of USD 1 billion over a period of ten years to bring fixed broadband service to unserved and underserved areas in Celestria. The RDF, jointly overseen by Celestria’s National Frequency Agency (the “NFA”) and the Rural Development Agency (the “RDA”), implemented a transparent and inclusive application procedure. It invited bids from both domestic and foreign telecommunications and internet service providers. Successful bidders were allocated a portion of the USD 1 billion fund, proportionate to their project’s scope, through a tripartite contract involving both the RDA and NFA. Payments from the fund to the winning bidder were structured to occur annually, following the relevant contract’s activation. On 15 February 2016, Astracommex Regional applied to the RDF with its LEO satellite mega-constellation architecture named the Astra System. The application detailed a network of 5000 satellites, set to operate at altitudes of 400, 450, 500, and 600 kilometers. By the time of the application, Astracommex Regional had launched 100 satellites from the Cosmosis overseas space center that operate at an altitude of 400km and secured a launch agreement for another 1400 satellites from the same facility by 1 October 2018. On 1 August 2016, the NFA and the RDA announced the successful applicants for the RDF funding. Among these, Astracommex Regional was selected as one of the three awardees, alongside two domestic terrestrial telecommunication companies, using optical fibers and 5G towers. Astracommex Regional was the only successful bidder relying on a satellite mega-constellation architecture. Subsequently, on 1 October 2016, Astracommex Regional entered into a Rural Digital Fund and Frequency Agreement (the “RDF Agreement”) with the NFA and the RDA. As stipulated in the RDF Agreement, Astracommex was granted the rights to utilize specific frequency spectrums within the allocated Ka-bands over the territory of Celestria and 500 million USD dollars. The RDF Agreement, set for a duration of ten years, went into effect immediately on the date of its signing. Despite the major progress made in the digitalization agenda of the Skydocker administration, the Government’s support faced growing challenges due to the increasingly apparent impacts of climate change on Celestria. As an insular State country with low elevation compared to its neighbors, Celestria is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change and natural disasters. Since the summer of 2013, the frequency of tropical storms, tsunamis, and extreme weather events in Celestria has notably increased. As a result, climate-driven migration escalated, with many of Celestria’s residents seeking refuge in the neighboring, well-developed state of Cosmosis. The level of migration reached a critical point in the summer of 2016, following a devastating tropical storm that wreaked havoc on Celestria’s coastal areas. In response to this crisis, on 15 October 2016, Cosmosis implemented stringent migration policies. These new regulations categorically denied asylum to Celestrian residents displaced by natural disasters and the effects of climate change. On the same day, during a press conference, the Prime Minister of Cosmosis publicly condemned Celestria for its failure to adequately protect its citizens from the impact of natural disasters. On 30 October 2016, Celestria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note verbale to Cosmosis’ embassy in Celestria, stating in relevant part: Celestria hereby expresses its formal objection to the recent migration policies instituted by Cosmosis. These policies, which discriminate against Celestrian nationals suffering the consequences of climate change, are of great concern. It is imperative to recognize that Cosmosis has been the leading global emitter of carbon and greenhouse gas since its industrial revolution in the last century. In light of this, Celestria urges Cosmosis not to shrink its international responsibilities pertaining to climate change. The tensions continued to escalate. On 1 November 2016, Cosmosis made a highly symbolic request for the return of Yorkie, an Astrain elephant native to Cosmosis. This species, notably sensitive to climate change, had been gifted to the national zoo of Celestria as a token of their once-amiable relationship. Celestria, however, denied the request. The denial to repatriate Yorkie and the series of events leading to this decision was portrayed in the media as the “Yorkie Crisis.” This incident sparked major demonstrations outside the Celestrian embassy in Cosmosis’ capital. On 1 January 2017, following the Yorkie crisis, the Prime Minister of Cosmosis decided to end its diplomatic relationship with Celestria. The following day, Cosmosis terminated the FTA in accordance with its article 15 procedure. The FTA was no longer effective to Cosmosis, Celestria, and Nebuland. On the same day, the overseas space center of Cosmosis announced the termination of its launch service contract with Astracommex Regional, citing impossibility of performance. As part of this termination, the space center compensated Astracommex Regional with liquidated damages. By 2 January 2017, Astracommex Regional had successfully launched 250 satellites into outer space and subsequently deployed in the planned orbits. Of these, 100 were positioned at an altitude of 400 kilometers, while the remaining 150 orbited at an altitude of 450 kilometers. To fully deploy the Astra System, an additional 4750 satellites were required to be positioned across orbits at altitudes of 450, 500, and 600 kilometers. On 16 January 2018, Astracommex Regional succeeded in securing alternative launch sites. The adjustment, however, resulted in a one-year delay in the original launch schedule. According to the revised plan, the Astra System aimed to deploy satellites in phases: 500 by 1 October 2018; 1500 by 1 October 2019; 2500 by 1 October 2020; 3500 by 1 October 2021; and a total of 5000 satellites by 1 October 2022. Astracommex Regional’s inability to meet the initial interim milestone of the RDF Agreement led to a one-year suspension of payments. Subsequently, payments resumed in 2019, and the milestone requirements in the RDF Agreement were modified to align with the new launch schedule. On 15 August 2019, Celestria suffered an almost complete internet blackout caused by an underwater volcanic eruption off its eastern coast, which severed its main subsea internet cable. The eruption severely impacted the Digital Health Project, which was in trial on ten islands, as medical centers couldn’t access vital online patient records and had no offline backups. Immediately after, Celestria requested satellite communication support from Astracommex Regional. On the following day, Astracommex Regional distributed user antennas to the affected medical facilities and activated its network. At that moment, the Astra System had 1400 satellites in operation. The network performance was poor. Users experienced substantial latency and signal attenuations, resulting in about 80% of the medical facilities being unable to access patient medical records. On 18 August 2019, Mr. Myskin explained to the press that the Astra System was not fully operational due to delayed launches. Mr. Myskin reassured that the service would meet its promised quality once it reached 1500 satellites in operation. This situation led to a decline in public confidence in the CUA’s digitalization efforts, and both Astracommex and the Digital Health Project were heavily criticized in the media for their roles in this crisis. The support for CUA plummeted substantially as indicated by newspaper polls conducted in September 2019. On 30 September 2019, the Astra System accomplished a significant milestone by successfully deploying 1500 satellites into orbit and officially activating its network. This marked the commencement of their Internet service offering in both Nebuland and Celestria. Astracommex Regional is in charge of managing client subscriptions and service delivery from Celestria, whereas Astracommex Global took on similar responsibilities for the Nebuland market. The users reported experiencing bearable latency while using Astracommex’s service. Astracommex assured its users that once there are cumulatively 2500 satellites in the Astra System, they will activate inter-satellite links and their broadband capacity will be able to surpass that of most ground-based networks. Meanwhile, newspaper surveys from October 2019 indicated a continuing decline in support of the CUA. In this time of crisis, the Green Party, long overshadowed by the CUA’s dazzle, found its voice. The Green Party was led by Ms. Billie Ruckelshaus, a civil rights activist, who was the prior high-level administrator of Celestria’s Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). Her abrupt resignation in November 2015, triggered by budget cut to the EPA in favor of funding digitalization initiatives (primarily the RDF) led by the RDA, marked a turning point. In October 2016, she founded the Green Party, gradually attracting support from environmental advocates. The party’s popularity saw a significant surge during the 2017 Yorkie crisis, as public opinion increasingly criticized the CUA’s apparent negligence of climate change and migration issues. On 15 January 2020, the Green Party secured a sweeping majority in the election and Ms. Ruckelshaus became the new president. She immediately issued a Presidential Order outlining ambitious environmental initiatives. These included the development of disaster alert systems along coastlines and islands, transitioning 50% of energy sources to renewable forms by 2028, and attaining carbon neutrality by 2040. To further these goals, the government introduced grants to encourage innovations in energy efficiency. As a result of these incentive-based strategies, there was a notable increase in government expenditure. On 1 April 2020, the Green Party enacted the National Environmental Protection Act (the “NEPA”) that requires every governmental agency to take full account of environmental impact assessments when determining whether the planned activities may proceed. In the meantime, the RDA’s high-level administrators were reappointed, and the RDA was restructured and formed a joint force with the EPA for sustainable development. On 15 May 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency released a study in the Celestria Journal of Astrophysics highlighting the negative impact of the Astracommex Satellites on astronomy. Subsequently, on 16 May 2020, an investigation was launched into the Astra System under the NEPA. The Celestrian Space Agency, responsible for overseeing civil space programs, aeronautic research, and space research, took the lead in the investigation. On 20 May 2020, Celestria’s largest non-profit amateur astronomy group published an open letter in Astra Nature Astronomy. This letter, calling for an immediate halt to the satellite light pollution caused by satellite mega-constellations like the Astra System, was also forwarded to the Celestrian Space Agency on the same day. On 1 June 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency, under the mandate of the NEPA, required Astracommex Regional to coordinate with both the Celestrian Space Agency and the amateur astronomy community. Pending the identification and implementation of these mitigating solutions, the Space Agency put a temporary halt to Astracommex Regional’s uplink and downlink communications near its ten radio observatories. Additionally, it designated radio silence zones in regions densely populated by amateur astronomers. As a result of these restrictions, the communication reach of the Astra System was effectively reduced to covering only 40 percent of Celestria’s territory. On 15 July 2020, Astracommex Regional introduced a proposal to the Celestrian Space Agency to mitigate the astronomical impact. It proposed (i) to paint the upcoming satellites with a less reflective color and fitted visors to reduce reflection; and (ii) to emit narrower transmission beams, thus reducing radio frequency interference. On 15 August 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency replied that the Agency would lift the operational restrictions, contingent on the successful implementation of these measures. The Celestrian Space Agency is a civil research and development agency of the Celestrian government. While the Celestrian Space Agency does not directly regulate commercial space programs, Celestrian domestic law empowers the Space Agency to establish radio silence zones and implement additional measures to ensure commercial space uses do not interfere with civil research endeavors. The jurisdiction of the Celestrian Space Agency is not challenged by the Claimant before both domestic courts and the current arbitral tribunal. However, these adaptations necessitated a shift to a different frequency spectrum within the Ku-bands for transmission purposes. This new spectrum fell outside of the original range authorized for Astracommex Regional’s operations in Celestria. On 5 September 2020, Astracommex Regional applied to the NFA for the required Ku-band frequencies, accompanied by relevant technical documentation related to telecommunications. On 1 October 2020, a study conducted by a laboratory sponsored by the EPA (see above) indicated potential unintended atmospheric impacts from Astracommex Regional’s LEO mega-constellation. By 1 October 2020, 2500 satellites were deployed successfully in the Astra System. On 2 October 2020, the NFA requested additional documentation from Astracommex Regional to specifically address these atmospheric concerns. On 15 October 2020, Astracommex Regional responded to the NFA, declining to provide the requested supplementary information. On 15 December 2020, the NFA rejected Astracommex Regional’s application to Ku-band frequencies on the basis of the NEPA. On 1 January 2021, one of Astracommex Regional’s satellites, AS100, collided with a cube satellite (cubesat) that wandered around the adjacent orbit on a crossed orbital plate. The cube satellite was run by Valinor, a private company, in partnership with Celestria’s Department of Defense (“DoD”). The cubesat was not equipped with any collision avoidance system and was smashed into small debris upon collision. AS100 was partially damaged — but both its Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) system and its communication system ceased to function. The data up until the impact moment indicated an interference to onboard computing system by extreme radiation. This record was transmitted and stored in the Astra System, and subsequently used by Astracommex’s engineers to assess the event and prepare software updates for existing and future Astra satellites. On 5 January 2021, the DoD initiated an investigation and ordered Astracommex Regional to suspend all satellite communications within the territory of Celestria. The DoD is charged by Celestrian domestic law with coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the Celestrian government directly related to national security. On 1 February 2021, after several months of negotiations, Nebuland and Celestria concluded an\n",

      "Metals from spacecraft reentry in stratospheric aerosol particles\n",
      "Geoscience Research Lab from Celestria Institute of Technology; Published 1 October 2020 When used rockets, retired satellites and other space debris fall back to Earth, they often burn up, creating metal vapors. These vapors then turn into tiny particles in the stratosphere. Previous studies mostly looked at the risk of space debris hitting the ground, not what happens to these vaporized metals. Now, we’ve found that these metal vapors can be clearly measured in stratospheric sulfuric acid particles. We detected over 20 different elements from reentry, matching the types of metals used in spacecraft. The amounts of lithium, aluminum, copper, and lead from these reentries are even more than what comes from cosmic dust. Roughly 10% of certain larger sulfuric acid particles in the stratosphere have these metals from spacecraft. As more satellites will be launched in the coming years, up to half of these stratospheric particles might contain reentry metals. However, it’s still unclear what effect this increased metallic presence will have on the stratosphere’s aerosols. The discovery of metals from spacecraft reentry in stratospheric sulfuric acid particles opens up the possibility of several potential impacts, although definitive consequences are yet to be determined. One significant concern is the effect these metals, particularly aluminum and other novel elements, might have on the formation of ice or nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) in the atmosphere. Given that polar stratospheric clouds form around a small fraction of particles, the introduction of new types of ice nuclei from spacecraft metals could have a substantial impact. Similarities have been noted between these metals and meteoric inclusions in sulfuric acid, which are known to act as ice nuclei. Furthermore, metal cations in these particles could lead to efflorescence, a process where water is released from the particles, potentially affecting atmospheric chemistry and physics. A reexamination of older mass spectra, in light of these findings, revealed the presence of particles from spacecraft reentry in ice residuals of high-altitude cirrus clouds as far back as 2002. However, the frequency of these particles in the clouds was not significantly different from that of meteoric elements. This suggests that while spacecraft reentry particles are indeed making their way into various atmospheric layers, their impact, particularly in comparison to natural meteoric elements, is still an area requiring further investigation. The space sector is currently experiencing significant expansion. The plan to deploy tens of thousands of small satellites into low Earth orbits will result in a greater number of these satellites eventually reentering the Earth’s atmosphere. Presently, about 10% of particles in the stratosphere have an increased concentration of aluminum. With the anticipated rise in satellite reentries, it is expected that in the next few decades, a similar proportion of stratospheric sulfuric acid particles will contain aluminum and other metals from these reentries, potentially reaching levels close to the current 50% of stratospheric particles that contain metals from meteors. ---Disclaimer--- The exhibit presented herein is based on the original research titled “Metals from spacecraft reentry in stratospheric aerosol particles” by Daniel Murphy et al, published in PNAS on 7 September 2023.

      "Dear Members of the Tribunal, \n",
      "We write on behalf of the Respondent in relation to the Claimant’s continuing bad faith conduct in this proceeding. Late payment of the initial advance payment requested by ICSID\n",
      "The Respondent recalls that in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 15(1)(a), ICSID sends an initial advance payment request to a claimant upon the registration of the proceeding “to defray the estimated costs of the proceeding through the first session of the [...] Tribunal.” On 25 September 2022, ICSID sent such a request to the Claimant requesting the payment of USD 150,000 by 25 October 2022. However, Astracommex did not make a payment by that date. After having notified Astracommex’s default and providing it with an extra 15 days to make the payment, the Secretary-General of ICSID suspended the proceeding for lack of payment on 16 November 2022. \n",
      "The Claimants finally paid the requested amount only on 15 February 2023, i.e., with a delay of 3 months. The Claimant’s failure to disclose its Third-Party Funder\n",
      "The Respondent recently discovered through the publication of the annual reports of two companies that Astracommex’s parent company issued a capital call to finance the present proceeding. These two companies must therefore be considered as Third-Party Funders (“TPF”). Consequently, the Claimant had a duty to disclose their existence pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 14 but deliberately chose to violate this provision. The Claimant’s conduct warrants the order of security for costs\n",
      "The Claimant’s late payment of the advance on costs and its reliance on TPF to finance this proceeding demonstrates that the Claimant is impecunious. The Claimant’s impecuniosity is further supported by the admission of its own quantum expert, Mr. Damus. \n",
      "The Claimants’ conduct combined with its impecuniosity will prevent Celestria from recovering any adverse costs if those are ordered by the Tribunal. \n",
      "Therefore, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 53(1), the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimant to post a security for costs in an amount not smaller than USD 2 million. \n",

      "This Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”) comprises the Tribunal’s decision on the Astracommex Regional’s and Celestria’s (together the “Parties”) requests to produce documents as set out in their respective Redfern schedules. The Tribunal’s decision on Astracommex Regional’s requests is set out in annex A to this PO2 and the Tribunal’s decision on Celestria’s requests is set out in annex B to this PO2. \n",

      "II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n",
      "[Intentionally omitted] \n",
      "\n",
      "III. APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES \n",
      "In accordance with paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO1”) and without prejudice to Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has been guided by ICSID Arbitration Rule 37 in evaluating the Parties’ requests (including their objections and replies). The Tribunal has carefully considered each of the requests, objections and replies made by the Parties as set out in their respective schedules. The Tribunal’s decision on each individual request is set out in the last column of the Parties’ Redfern schedules. \n",
      "\n",
      "IV. THE TRIBUNAL’S GENERAL OBSERVATIONS \n",
      "For the avoidance of doubt, the term “document” has the meaning of a writing, communication, picture, drawing, program or data of any kind, whether recorded or maintained on paper or by electronic, audio, visual or any other means. Where ordered to do so, the Parties are required to produce documents that are within their possession, custody or control. Any document the production of which is ordered by the Tribunal shall be communicated within the time limit set out in the Procedural Timetable, directly to the requesting Party without copying the Tribunal. Documents produced voluntarily as well as those produced pursuant to this PO2, shall only form part of the record if and when they are submitted as exhibits to the main pleadings. Otherwise, they shall not be taken into account by the Tribunal. The Parties must undertake reasonable searches in relation to the requests that have been granted or voluntarily complied with. Any search that has already been undertaken by a Party does not need to be carried out again, provided that such search was reasonable. The Tribunal directs that where a party wishes to assert privilege, legal impediment or confidentiality over a responsive document that it has been ordered to produce (or as otherwise directed by the Tribunal), it should record that document in a privilege and confidentiality log to be provided to the other side. The Parties must produce any privilege and confidentiality logs at the latest on the 15 June 2024. \n",
      "\n",
      "V. DECISION \n",
      "In light of the above, after having carefully considered the assertions made by the Parties and taking into account the applicable principles, the Tribunal unanimously: \n",
      "i. DECIDES on the Parties’ requests as set out in the Redfern schedules that are attached to this PO2 as annexes A and annex B, subject to the Parties applying the agreed and reasonable search terms and date ranges as ordered above. These annexes form an integral part of the PO2. \n",
      "ii. ORDERS each Party to produce the documents pertaining to each of the requests that have been fully or partially granted by 15 June 2024 at the latest. Each Party that wishes to assert that any of the documents to be disclosed or part thereof is privileged, subject to legal impediment or confidential, to file a privilege and confidentiality log in accordance with the general guidelines above.

      "23. Any and all documents and communications between Celestria and Valinor between December 2020 and June 2021 regarding the collision between Astracommex’s AS100 and Valinor’s satellite, including, without being limited to, emails or other communications, minutes of meetings, reports, presentations and/or decisions of authorities. Astracommex submits that Astracommex was not liable for the collision. Celestria used the incident to initiate an investigation against Astracommex and to suspend the operation of satellites. This move was discriminatory because no investigation and suspension of operations was issued for Valinor. The requested documents are relevant to assess whether the behavior of the Department of Defense was non-discriminatory and justified. Celestria objects to the request for the following reasons: \n",
      "• Complying with the request is likely to entail data protection issues. As Valinor is in a long-term partnership with Celestria’s military, the search will likely entail data protection issues. Celestria should not have to incur such a risk. The request is unreasonably burdensome. The request should be dismissed because of the overwhelming likelihood that requested documents will be privileged or confidential. Celestria should not be required to incur the costs and efforts to look for and log such documents. Astracommex maintains the request and respectfully applies to the Tribunal to order the production of responsive documents. \n",
      "• Celestria failed to specify and substantiate the alleged “data protection issues.” Celestria did not even attempt to conduct a reasonable search and only speculates that such search would “likely entail” unspecified “data protection issues.” This objection is therefore too unspecific for Astracommex to respond to. The request is reasonable in its scope and is not burdensome. Celestria again only “expects” the search to be burdensome, without providing any reason. Moreover, the request is not more burdensome than any other document production request. The Request relates to matters potentially relevant to this arbitration and is granted, unless said documents are privileged or confidential under PO2. \n",

The Republic of Celestria (“Celestria”), the Respondent in the present proceeding, hereby \\nsubmits a short response to the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration (the “Response”). 2. In this Response, unless otherwise stated, the Respondent adopts the abbreviations used in the \\nClaimant’s Request for Arbitration. 3. Unless otherwise stated, the Respondent disagrees with every statement made by the Claimant \\nin the Request for Arbitration. \\nII. THE \\nTRIBUNAL \\nLACKS \\nJURISDICTION \\nRATIONE \\nTEMPORIS \\nTO \\nENTERTAIN THE CLAIMANT’S CLAIM \\n4. The Respondent considers that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over the dispute.'),\n",
       "  (1,\n",
       "   '5. Article 2 of the BIT defines its scope and provides that “[t]his Agreement shall apply to legal \\ndisputes in relation to investments that existed at the time of entry into force as well as to \\ninvestments made or acquired thereafter.” 6. Article 2 of the BIT is silent on whether it applies to disputes that existed prior to its entry into \\nforce. Therefore, the Tribunal should apply general international law and notably Article 28 of \\nthe Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties which entered into force on 27 January 1980 \\n(“VCLT”) and provides that: \\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its \\nprovisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation \\nwhich ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to \\nthat party. 7. In the case at hand, the intention of the BIT’s contracting parties was to exclude disputes that \\narose prior to its entry into force, as the contracting parties made clear in a binding interpretive \\nstatement that they issued on 10 October 2022.'),\n",
       "  (2,\n",
       "   '8. Furthermore, the dispute between the Parties arose and crystallized prior to the entry into force \\nof the BIT for several reasons. 9. First, the root of the dispute between the Parties is the denial by Astracommex Regional of\\nCelestria’s right to adopt environmental regulations as shown by the comments of its CEO on\\nthe date of the adoption of the NEPA. 10. Second, on 15 October 2020, faced with the request by the NFA to produce additional materials\\nconcerning the atmospheric impact of Astra satellite reentries, Astracommex Regional sent a\\nletter to the NFA contesting such request and declining to “provide additional materials.” Astracommex Regional thus disregarded a request made by an agency of Celestria.\\n11. Third, most of the factual matrix on which the Claimant is relying upon in the Request occurred\\nprior to the entry into force of the BIT.\\n12. Accordingly, the Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to declare that it lacks\\njurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims against the Respondent.\\nIII.'),\n",
       "  (3,\n",
       "   'THE RESPONDENT’S MEASURES DO NOT AMOUNT TO EXPROPRIATION\\n13. If the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection, the Respondent affirms\\nthat it respected at all times its treaty obligations towards the Claimant. The Respondent\\nundertook regulatory and administrative measures within its power for the safety and well-\\nbeing of its citizens and the environment. None of the Respondent’s actions constitutes\\nexpropriation under Article VII of the BIT.\\n14. First, the Claimant retains the ownership, operation, and control over all its satellites and\\ncontinues to provide services on territories other than that of the Respondent, for instance in\\nthe Kingdom of Nebuland. As such, the Respondent opposes the Claimant’s conclusion that it\\nhad suffered any deprivation of its property rights, not to mention a “significant deprivation.”\\n15. Moreover, the Claimant’s assertions as to the permanent nature of the suspension of the\\nClaimant’s satellite communications within Celestria’s territory are also unfounded.'),\n",
       "  (4,\n",
       "   'The\\nClaimant’s operations are suspended only until the Claimant successfully repositions the\\n400km satellites, of which, as the Claimant itself submitted, the satellites are more than\\ncapable. It is thus by the Claimant’s own choice that its operations remain suspended. The \\nsuspension cannot be deemed permanent in nature. 16. Lastly, out of abundance of caution, the Respondent notes that Celestria has made the following\\nnotification under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention:\\nPursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention, the Republic of Celestria will only \\nconsider submitting disputes over expropriation and nationalization to the jurisdiction of \\nthe International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. IV.\\nIN ANY EVENT, THE MEASURES ARE JUSTIFIED UNDER THE APPLICABLE\\nINTERNATIONAL LAW\\n17. The regulatory actions from respectively the Celestrian Space Agency, the National Frequency\\nAgency (“NFA”), and the Department of Defense (“DoD”) are justifiable and thus do not entail\\nthe international responsibility of the Respondent.'),\n",
       "  (5,\n",
       "   '18. The Celestrian Space Agency’s action is a legitimate exercise of police power for public\\nwelfare. Optical and radio astronomy are important for the public not only for purposes of\\nscience, but also for preventing or mitigating catastrophic events like asteroid impact. As part\\nof the UN-endorsed International Asteroid Warning Network (“IAWN”), the Celestrian Space\\nAgency utilizes its ten major telescopes for discovering, monitoring, and physically\\ncharacterizing the potentially hazardous near-Earth objects.\\n19. The NFA’s decision was informed by evidence of atmospheric impacts gathered by the\\nCelestria Institute of Technology, a laboratory sponsored by the Environmental Protection\\nAgency (“EPA”). The NFA’s approach aligns with the precautionary principle enshrined in\\nArticle V of the BIT. The principle’s objective is to anticipate and avoid environmental damage\\nbefore it occurs, in recognition of the need to protect human health and the environment by\\ntaking precautionary measures while scientific studies are undertaken to qualify the risk or\\nrisks associated with a course of action.'),\n",
       "  (6,\n",
       "   'The absence of evidence that mass scale satellite\\nreentries would not negatively impact the stratosphere was sufficient to activate the principle. 20. The DoD’s measures address concerns about environmental impacts from space debris and\\nnational security, including potential collision with DoD’s military assets in adjacent orbits. The DoD investigation revealed both software and hardware flaws in the Claimant’s system,\\nthreatening Celestria’s essential security. The Claimant asserted that the DoD decision was\\n“outside of Celestria’s jurisdiction.” However, the Respondent was not claiming jurisdiction\\nover the Claimant’s satellites per se. Instead, it was regulating the use of outer space orbits,\\nwhich are designated as global commons under Article I of the Outer Space Treaty:\\nOuter space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be free for exploration and \\nuse by all States without discrimination of any kind […] and there shall be free access to \\nall areas of celestial bodies.'),\n",

Regarding the software, the algorithm Astracommex used to predict relies predominantly on data collected by the Space Surveillance Network of Cosmosis. Since the cessation of Cosmosis-Celestria diplomatic relations, Celestria has shut down all of Cosmosis’ terrestrial radar operations within Celestria’s borders, coupled with subsequent national security regulations prohibiting sensitive data transfer to Cosmosis. These measures have significantly impacted Cosmosis’ Space Surveillance Network’s accuracy on Celestria related space activities.'),\n",

This flaw, as our investigation suggests, cannot be rectified with software updates as previously suggested by Astracommex. The heightened risks of collision in space, particularly due to the potential onset of Kessler Syndrome, significantly compromises the safety of Celestria’s space operations. The issue is especially pertinent for the Department of Defense’s assets operating in 400km altitude orbits, where the risk of satellite collisions presents a national security concern. Kessler Syndrome is a scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbits (LEO) due to space pollution is numerous enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions. Moreover, such collisions are a primary source of space debris, i.e., space junk.'),\n",

Scientists need to take a stronger stance against “big light” and “big space” in order to protect this natural resource. Light pollution, produced both at Earth’s surface and from low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, is rapidly increasing. Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an anthropogenic pollutant, as defined since 1979 by the United Nations: “[a]ir pollution means the introduction by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy into the air resulting in deleterious effects of such a nature as to endanger human health, harm living resources and ecosystems and material property and impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment, and ‘air pollutants’ shall be construed accordingly,” where “energy is understood to include heat, light, noise and radioactivity introduced and released into the atmosphere through human activities.”'),\n",

The Prime Minister of Cosmosis, Nigel Palpatinous, delivered a stark rebuke today of Celestria’s failure in handling climate change issues. He criticized the neighboring nation for its apparent inability to adequately protect its population from escalating threats posed by climate change. This, he suggested, not only compromises Celestria’s own stability but also poses a substantial setback to the collective global effort to address the climate crisis. Since the summer of 2013, Cosmosis, the only neighboring state that is connected to Celestria by land, has emerged as a major destination for Celestrians displaced by climate change. The once tranquil border area of Cosmosis is now grappling with safety concerns and resource strains caused by homeless migrants.'),\n",

It makes absolutely no sense for Cosmosis taxpayers to pay for Celestria’s failure!” The situation reached a critical point following a devastating tropical storm in the summer of 2016, leading to an unprecedented surge in refugee numbers. In a decisive move, Prime Minister Palpatinous announced Cosmosis’ first-ever climate migration policy, denying asylum to Celestrian residents displaced by natural disasters and climate change effects.

       "   'SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE \\n6. The Claimant, along with its parent company, focuses on non-terrestrial communication technologies. It delivers affordable internet access globally and especially targets unserved and underserved populations in rural and remote areas. Leveraging cutting-edge telecommunications technology, Astracommex Global has pioneered the revolutionary concept of a low-Earth-orbit (“LEO”) satellite mega-constellation. This concept involves deploying a vast network of 5,000 satellites across various altitudes - 400, 450, 500, and 600 kilometers above Earth - to establish a high-speed, high-quality, and cost-effective non-terrestrial communication network. A standout feature of this network is the utilization of inter-satellite optical links, enhancing speed and efficiency. 7. The Claimant was attracted to Celestria primarily by its digitalization agenda. The Respondent has consistently affirmed its dedication to advancing digitalization projects in rural areas since 2010. An example is the flagship digital health project which the Respondent promoted in 2015, creating a promising market for internet service providers like the Claimant. 8.'),\n",
       "  (3,\n",
       "   'In 2016, the Respondent inaugurated the Rural Digitalization Fund (“RDF”) with a substantial grant of USD 1 billion, reiterating its commitment to narrowing the gap between rural and urban areas by ensuring universal access to internet communication services across its territory. The Respondent actively encouraged foreign investors, such as the Claimant, to invest in its territory. To that end, the Respondent invited bids from both foreign and domestic internet service providers for the allocation of the RDF funds and the necessary radio frequencies. 9. On 15 February 2016, the Claimant submitted its application in the auction organized by the Respondent, presenting a LEO satellite mega-constellation (named the “Astra System”). The Claimant won the bid in August of thintoe same year. 10. The Respondent’s National Frequency Agency (“NFA”) and Rural Development Agency (“RDA”) subsequently entered into a contract with the Claimant on 1 October 2016 (the “RDF Agreement”), providing the Claimant with USD 500 million and allocating the necessary Ka-band frequencies for a ten-year period.'),\n",
       "  (4,\n",
       "   'Since then, the Claimant has been conscientiously developing and installing the Astra satellites as well as the ground stations on the territory of the Respondent, in order to deliver the promised quality of internet services. 11. However, in January 2020, following the change in the Respondent’s Government, the Respondent began to slowly backtrack on its commitments, taking a multitude of measures that ultimately stripped the Claimant of its investment. 12. As a first step, the Respondent enacted the National Environmental Protection Act (the “NEPA”). The NEPA, despite stating that it would not apply retroactively, was interpreted broadly in practice in terms of what constitutes “future agency actions.” This interpretation opened the door to a series of wide-ranging measures against the Claimant that caused the Claimant’s eventual loss of all of its operations in relation to the territory of Celestria. 13. On 1 June 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency established radio silence zones which de facto reduced the communication reach of the Astra System from covering 100% of Celestria’s territory to covering only 40%.'),\n",
       "  (5,\n",
       "   'Even though the Celestrian Space Agency relied on scant scientific evidence to make its decision, the Claimant cooperated in good faith and offered new plans to mitigate any potential impact on astronomy. The new plan obliged the Claimant to apply for a new Ku-band spectrum to operate. The Claimant was optimistic that the plan would be simple to execute because Article 6 of the RDF Agreement allows for the modification of support from the NFA and RDA under specific conditions. 14. However, during the NFA’s processing of the Claimant’s request for the new Ku-band frequencies, the NFA requested the Claimant to submit supplementary materials to facilitate an environmental impact assessment regarding the reentry of the satellites. The Claimant refused to submit further documents and such refusal resulted in a long silence from the NFA. The application was kept pending and was finally rejected on 15 December 2020. 15. On 1 January 2021, an unfortunate collision happened between one of the Claimant’s satellites, AS100, and a cubesat owned by Valinor, a private company, and sponsored by the Respondent’s Department of Defense (“DoD”).'),\n",
       "  (6,\n",
       "   'Based on the Claimant’s engineers’ post-collision assessment of its proprietary software, the collision was due to an electronic malfunction induced by an unusual solar radiation storm. 16. On 5 January 2021, the DoD initiated an investigation and suspended the Claimant’s operations on Celestria’s territory. 17. On 1 March 2021, the DoD abruptly ordered the Claimant to reposition of all of its 400km altitude satellites to new orbits below 350km. To add salt to the injury, the DoD also ordered a continuing suspension of the Claimant’s operation on the territory of Celestria until the reposition was completed. 18. The orbits and plans of all the 5,000 satellites in the current Astra System were deliberately and carefully engineered. While the Claimant possesses the technical capacities to reposition of the 400km satellites, such action will cost the Claimant USD 1 billion. In addition, the Claimant will need an authorization from the NFA to use the new spectrums due to the adjusted configuration.'),\n",
       "  (7,\n",
       "   'The Claimant recalls, however, that the NFA rejected its request for Ku-band frequencies on 15 December 2020. Chances of the NFA accepting another request are slim. 19. Moreover, the Claimant’s 400km satellites were launched from the Kingdom of Cosmosis (“Cosmosis”) before the diplomatic relationship between the Respondent and Cosmosis broke down following the climate migration crisis. According to the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Registration Convention of 1974, Cosmosis has quasi-territorial jurisdiction over the 400km satellites. The Respondent thus has no authority to enforce such an order. 20. Due to the series of the Respondent’s measures, the Claimant’s business activities in Celestria have ceased entirely. Although the Claimant retains ownership of its assets, including the ground stations within the Respondent’s jurisdiction and the Astra satellites in outer space, it has been rendered incapable of conducting any business activities within the Respondent’s territory. The multi-agency actions amount to a comprehensive and permanent prohibition on the Claimant’s provision of internet services within the Respondent’s territory.'),\n",

The primary function of laser transmitters is to establish inter-satellite links. These links allow satellites to communicate directly with each other in orbit, which is crucial for minimizing network latency. The orbit and relative position of Astra satellites are carefully engineered to ensure reliable data flow among the high-velocity satellites. Notably, the laser wavelength utilized by the Astra satellites is distinct from the wavelengths observable by optical telescopes, thereby mitigating the risk of interference with astronomical observations.'),\n",

This system harnesses tracking data from both onboard sensors and data shared via the Space Surveillance Network (“SSN”). The SSN is organized by the Department of Defense of the Kingdom of Cosmosis and is renowned for its comprehensive coverage in tracking objects in orbit around the Earth. The collision avoidance system operates in real-time, constantly assessing the likelihood of collisions and making split-second decisions to alter the satellite’s course when necessary. Every Astra satellite is equipped with cutting-edge ion thrusters powered by krypton. These thrusters allow Astra satellites to change their orbits when the onboard computer determines that a maneuver is necessary to avoid a potential collision.

       "   'STATEMENT OF UNCONTESTED FACTS\\n\\nThe present proceeding results from a series of measures taken by several agencies of the Republic of Celestria (“Celestria”) that allegedly affect the operation of Astracommex Regional Satellite Communication Inc. (“Astracommex Regional”) on the territory of Celestria. Celestria is a middle-income island nation with one principal island, twelve medium-sized islands, and seventy-three smaller isles. Around sixty percent of its population resides in rural and isolated areas. The nation’s key economic sectors include traditional manufacturing, agriculture, and fishing. Operating under a presidential system, Celestria elects its president every five years by direct popular vote. In the 2010 election, the leader of the Celestria Unity Alliance (“CUA”), Mr. Andreas Skydocker, secured the presidency. The primary agenda of his party focused on boosting the economy through digitalization and channeling both public and private investments towards the development of digital infrastructures.'),\n",
       "  (1,\n",
       "   'Celestria is located in the Astral Archipelago Region. It shares a land border with the Kingdom of Cosmosis (“Cosmosis”) and is encircled by other states, including the Kingdom of Nebuland (“Nebuland”), from which it is separated by sea. Cosmosis is a developed state renowned for its globally dominant aerospace and space sector. Cosmosis owns an overseas space center in the equatorial region as one of its major research and launching sites. Nebuland is a developed State with an advanced tech industry, characterized by its robust ecosystem of start-ups, established tech giants, and research institutions. Celestria, Nebuland, and Cosmosis were parties to a Free Trade Agreement (the “FTA”) that entered into force on 2 December 2003. Astracommex Regional is a corporation established in 2015 under the laws of Nebuland with its principal place of business in Stelaria, the capital of Nebuland. Astracommex Regional operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary with all of its shares held by its parent company, Astracommex Global Satellite Communication Inc. (“Astracommex Global”), which is also organized under the laws of Nebuland.'),\n",
       "  (2,\n",
       "   'Astracommex Regional was established with the aim of managing and overseeing the operations in the Astral Archipelago Region’s nations outside of Nebuland. Mr. Jeffrey Myskin, the CEO of both Astracommex Regional and Astracommex Global, holds a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Nebuland Institute of Technology. Following his graduation, he and his university friends started a space lab in 2008 where they innovated and patented several space telecommunication technologies including advanced transmitters and antennas. The team’s effort led to the founding of Astracommex Global in 2011, with the ambition to create a global high-speed, high-quality, and affordable space communication network. The network aims to provide internet connectivity in areas typically unserved or underserved by traditional terrestrial infrastructure, such as rural regions, remote islands, ships, and aircraft. In the summer of 2014, Astracommex Global introduced its groundbreaking low-Earth-orbit (“LEO”) satellite mega-constellation concept and swiftly gathered significant venture capital investments from Marcial Ventures Ltd (“Marcial”) and Platonial Investments (“Platonial”).'),\n",
       "  (3,\n",
       "   'Marcial and Platonial together hold a 25% equity stake in Astracommex Global. Concurrently, under the leadership of President Skydocker, Celestria was vigorously advancing its digitalization initiatives. A notable step in this direction was Celestria’s application to the regional development bank on 1 January 2015, for funding of a digital health project, which received approval on 1 June 2015. The Digital Health Project aimed to create an integrated digital health information system across Celestria. Its primary goal was to bridge the information gaps between medical institutions on the various islands, thereby enhancing the quality of medical services available to the Celestrian population. The Project also involved collaboration with private sector companies for software provision, network connectivity, and other technical support, stimulating economic growth. The health data collected in the Digital Health Project, with the consent of individual patients, was set to be utilized by partnering pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers.'),\n",
       "  (4,\n",
       "   'The Project was promoted by the Skydocker administration as a prime example of how digital infrastructure can facilitate the growth of the national economy as a whole. On 1 January 2016, Celestria launched a Rural Digitalization Fund (the “RDF”). The primary aim of the RDF was to bridge the digital divide in Celestria, ensuring that communities and small businesses in rural areas had access to the same quality of internet communication services as urban areas. Celestria allocated to the RDF an amount of USD 1 billion over a period of ten years to bring fixed broadband service to unserved and underserved areas in Celestria. The RDF, jointly overseen by Celestria’s National Frequency Agency (the “NFA”) and the Rural Development Agency (the “RDA”), implemented a transparent and inclusive application procedure. It invited bids from both domestic and foreign telecommunications and internet service providers. Successful bidders were allocated a portion of the USD 1 billion fund, proportionate to their project’s scope, through a tripartite contract involving both the RDA and NFA.'),\n",
       "  (5,\n",
       "   'Payments from the fund to the winning bidder were structured to occur annually, following the relevant contract’s activation. On 15 February 2016, Astracommex Regional applied to the RDF with its LEO satellite mega-constellation architecture named the Astra System. The application detailed a network of 5000 satellites, set to operate at altitudes of 400, 450, 500, and 600 kilometers. By the time of the application, Astracommex Regional had launched 100 satellites from the Cosmosis overseas space center that operate at an altitude of 400km and secured a launch agreement for another 1400 satellites from the same facility by 1 October 2018. On 1 August 2016, the NFA and the RDA announced the successful applicants for the RDF funding. Among these, Astracommex Regional was selected as one of the three awardees, alongside two domestic terrestrial telecommunication companies, using optical fibers and 5G towers. Astracommex Regional was the only successful bidder relying on a satellite mega-constellation architecture.'),\n",
       "  (6,\n",
       "   'Subsequently, on 1 October 2016, Astracommex Regional entered into a Rural Digital Fund and Frequency Agreement (the “RDF Agreement”) with the NFA and the RDA. As stipulated in the RDF Agreement, Astracommex was granted the rights to utilize specific frequency spectrums within the allocated Ka-bands over the territory of Celestria and 500 million USD dollars. The RDF Agreement, set for a duration of ten years, went into effect immediately on the date of its signing. Despite the major progress made in the digitalization agenda of the Skydocker administration, the Government’s support faced growing challenges due to the increasingly apparent impacts of climate change on Celestria. As an insular State country with low elevation compared to its neighbors, Celestria is particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change and natural disasters. Since the summer of 2013, the frequency of tropical storms, tsunamis, and extreme weather events in Celestria has notably increased. As a result, climate-driven migration escalated, with many of Celestria’s residents seeking refuge in the neighboring, well-developed state of Cosmosis.'),\n",
       "  (7,\n",
       "   'The level of migration reached a critical point in the summer of 2016, following a devastating tropical storm that wreaked havoc on Celestria’s coastal areas. In response to this crisis, on 15 October 2016, Cosmosis implemented stringent migration policies. These new regulations categorically denied asylum to Celestrian residents displaced by natural disasters and the effects of climate change. On the same day, during a press conference, the Prime Minister of Cosmosis publicly condemned Celestria for its failure to adequately protect its citizens from the impact of natural disasters. On 30 October 2016, Celestria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note verbale to Cosmosis’ embassy in Celestria, stating in relevant part: Celestria hereby expresses its formal objection to the recent migration policies instituted by Cosmosis. These policies, which discriminate against Celestrian nationals suffering the consequences of climate change, are of great concern. It is imperative to recognize that Cosmosis has been the leading global emitter of carbon and greenhouse gas since its industrial revolution in the last century.'),\n",
       "  (8,\n",
       "   'In light of this, Celestria urges Cosmosis not to shrink its international responsibilities pertaining to climate change. The tensions continued to escalate. On 1 November 2016, Cosmosis made a highly symbolic request for the return of Yorkie, an Astrain elephant native to Cosmosis. This species, notably sensitive to climate change, had been gifted to the national zoo of Celestria as a token of their once-amiable relationship. Celestria, however, denied the request. The denial to repatriate Yorkie and the series of events leading to this decision was portrayed in the media as the “Yorkie Crisis.” This incident sparked major demonstrations outside the Celestrian embassy in Cosmosis’ capital. On 1 January 2017, following the Yorkie crisis, the Prime Minister of Cosmosis decided to end its diplomatic relationship with Celestria. The following day, Cosmosis terminated the FTA in accordance with its article 15 procedure. The FTA was no longer effective to Cosmosis, Celestria, and Nebuland. On the same day, the overseas space center of Cosmosis announced the termination of its launch service contract with Astracommex Regional, citing impossibility of performance.'),\n",
       "  (9,\n",
       "   'As part of this termination, the space center compensated Astracommex Regional with liquidated damages. By 2 January 2017, Astracommex Regional had successfully launched 250 satellites into outer space and subsequently deployed in the planned orbits. Of these, 100 were positioned at an altitude of 400 kilometers, while the remaining 150 orbited at an altitude of 450 kilometers. To fully deploy the Astra System, an additional 4750 satellites were required to be positioned across orbits at altitudes of 450, 500, and 600 kilometers. On 16 January 2018, Astracommex Regional succeeded in securing alternative launch sites. The adjustment, however, resulted in a one-year delay in the original launch schedule. According to the revised plan, the Astra System aimed to deploy satellites in phases: 500 by 1 October 2018; 1500 by 1 October 2019; 2500 by 1 October 2020; 3500 by 1 October 2021; and a total of 5000 satellites by 1 October 2022. Astracommex Regional’s inability to meet the initial interim milestone of the RDF Agreement led to a one-year suspension of payments.'),\n",
       "  (10,\n",
       "   'Subsequently, payments resumed in 2019, and the milestone requirements in the RDF Agreement were modified to align with the new launch schedule. On 15 August 2019, Celestria suffered an almost complete internet blackout caused by an underwater volcanic eruption off its eastern coast, which severed its main subsea internet cable. The eruption severely impacted the Digital Health Project, which was in trial on ten islands, as medical centers couldn’t access vital online patient records and had no offline backups. Immediately after, Celestria requested satellite communication support from Astracommex Regional. On the following day, Astracommex Regional distributed user antennas to the affected medical facilities and activated its network. At that moment, the Astra System had 1400 satellites in operation. The network performance was poor. Users experienced substantial latency and signal attenuations, resulting in about 80% of the medical facilities being unable to access patient medical records.'),\n",
       "  (11,\n",
       "   'On 18 August 2019, Mr. Myskin explained to the press that the Astra System was not fully operational due to delayed launches. Mr. Myskin reassured that the service would meet its promised quality once it reached 1500 satellites in operation. This situation led to a decline in public confidence in the CUA’s digitalization efforts, and both Astracommex and the Digital Health Project were heavily criticized in the media for their roles in this crisis. The support for CUA plummeted substantially as indicated by newspaper polls conducted in September 2019. On 30 September 2019, the Astra System accomplished a significant milestone by successfully deploying 1500 satellites into orbit and officially activating its network. This marked the commencement of their Internet service offering in both Nebuland and Celestria. Astracommex Regional is in charge of managing client subscriptions and service delivery from Celestria, whereas Astracommex Global took on similar responsibilities for the Nebuland market.'),\n",
       "  (12,\n",
       "   'The users reported experiencing bearable latency while using Astracommex’s service. Astracommex assured its users that once there are cumulatively 2500 satellites in the Astra System, they will activate inter-satellite links and their broadband capacity will be able to surpass that of most ground-based networks. Meanwhile, newspaper surveys from October 2019 indicated a continuing decline in support of the CUA. In this time of crisis, the Green Party, long overshadowed by the CUA’s dazzle, found its voice. The Green Party was led by Ms. Billie Ruckelshaus, a civil rights activist, who was the prior high-level administrator of Celestria’s Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). Her abrupt resignation in November 2015, triggered by budget cut to the EPA in favor of funding digitalization initiatives (primarily the RDF) led by the RDA, marked a turning point. In October 2016, she founded the Green Party, gradually attracting support from environmental advocates. The party’s popularity saw a significant surge during the 2017 Yorkie crisis, as public opinion increasingly criticized the CUA’s apparent negligence of climate change and migration issues.'),\n",
       "  (13,\n",
       "   'On 15 January 2020, the Green Party secured a sweeping majority in the election and Ms. Ruckelshaus became the new president. She immediately issued a Presidential Order outlining ambitious environmental initiatives. These included the development of disaster alert systems along coastlines and islands, transitioning 50% of energy sources to renewable forms by 2028, and attaining carbon neutrality by 2040. To further these goals, the government introduced grants to encourage innovations in energy efficiency. As a result of these incentive-based strategies, there was a notable increase in government expenditure. On 1 April 2020, the Green Party enacted the National Environmental Protection Act (the “NEPA”) that requires every governmental agency to take full account of environmental impact assessments when determining whether the planned activities may proceed. In the meantime, the RDA’s high-level administrators were reappointed, and the RDA was restructured and formed a joint force with the EPA for sustainable development.'),\n",

       "   'On 15 May 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency released a study in the Celestria Journal of Astrophysics highlighting the negative impact of the Astracommex Satellites on astronomy. Subsequently, on 16 May 2020, an investigation was launched into the Astra System under the NEPA. The Celestrian Space Agency, responsible for overseeing civil space programs, aeronautic research, and space research, took the lead in the investigation. On 20 May 2020, Celestria’s largest non-profit amateur astronomy group published an open letter in Astra Nature Astronomy. This letter, calling for an immediate halt to the satellite light pollution caused by satellite mega-constellations like the Astra System, was also forwarded to the Celestrian Space Agency on the same day. On 1 June 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency, under the mandate of the NEPA, required Astracommex Regional to coordinate with both the Celestrian Space Agency and the amateur astronomy community. Pending the identification and implementation of these mitigating solutions, the Space Agency put a temporary halt to Astracommex Regional’s uplink and downlink communications near its ten radio observatories.'),\n",
       "  (15,\n",
       "   'Additionally, it designated radio silence zones in regions densely populated by amateur astronomers. As a result of these restrictions, the communication reach of the Astra System was effectively reduced to covering only 40 percent of Celestria’s territory. On 15 July 2020, Astracommex Regional introduced a proposal to the Celestrian Space Agency to mitigate the astronomical impact. It proposed (i) to paint the upcoming satellites with a less reflective color and fitted visors to reduce reflection; and (ii) to emit narrower transmission beams, thus reducing radio frequency interference. On 15 August 2020, the Celestrian Space Agency replied that the Agency would lift the operational restrictions, contingent on the successful implementation of these measures. The Celestrian Space Agency is a civil research and development agency of the Celestrian government. While the Celestrian Space Agency does not directly regulate commercial space programs, Celestrian domestic law empowers the Space Agency to establish radio silence zones and implement additional measures to ensure commercial space uses do not interfere with civil research endeavors.'),\n",

On 5 September 2020, Astracommex Regional applied to the NFA for the required Ku-band frequencies, accompanied by relevant technical documentation related to telecommunications. On 1 October 2020, a study conducted by a laboratory sponsored by the EPA (see above) indicated potential unintended atmospheric impacts from Astracommex Regional’s LEO mega-constellation. By 1 October 2020, 2500 satellites were deployed successfully in the Astra System.

These vapors then turn into tiny particles in the stratosphere. Previous studies mostly looked at the risk of space debris hitting the ground, not what happens to these vaporized metals. Now, we’ve found that these metal vapors can be clearly measured in stratospheric sulfuric acid particles. We detected over 20 different elements from reentry, matching the types of metals used in spacecraft. The amounts of lithium, aluminum, copper, and lead from these reentries are even more than what comes from cosmic dust. Roughly 10% of certain larger sulfuric acid particles in the stratosphere have these metals from spacecraft.'),\n",
       "  (1,\n",
       "   'As more satellites will be launched in the coming years, up to half of these stratospheric particles might contain reentry metals. However, it’s still unclear what effect this increased metallic presence will have on the stratosphere’s aerosols. The discovery of metals from spacecraft reentry in stratospheric sulfuric acid particles opens up the possibility of several potential impacts, although definitive consequences are yet to be determined. One significant concern is the effect these metals, particularly aluminum and other novel elements, might have on the formation of ice or nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) in the atmosphere. Given that polar stratospheric clouds form around a small fraction of particles, the introduction of new types of ice nuclei from spacecraft metals could have a substantial impact. Similarities have been noted between these metals and meteoric inclusions in sulfuric acid, which are known to act as ice nuclei. Furthermore, metal cations in these particles could lead to efflorescence, a process where water is released from the particles, potentially affecting atmospheric chemistry and physics.'),\n",
       "  (2,\n",
       "   'A reexamination of older mass spectra, in light of these findings, revealed the presence of particles from spacecraft reentry in ice residuals of high-altitude cirrus clouds as far back as 2002. However, the frequency of these particles in the clouds was not significantly different from that of meteoric elements. This suggests that while spacecraft reentry particles are indeed making their way into various atmospheric layers, their impact, particularly in comparison to natural meteoric elements, is still an area requiring further investigation. The space sector is currently experiencing significant expansion. The plan to deploy tens of thousands of small satellites into low Earth orbits will result in a greater number of these satellites eventually reentering the Earth’s atmosphere. Presently, about 10% of particles in the stratosphere have an increased concentration of aluminum. With the anticipated rise in satellite reentries, it is expected that in the next few decades, a similar proportion of stratospheric sulfuric acid particles will contain aluminum and other metals from these reentries, potentially reaching levels close to the current 50% of stratospheric particles that contain metals from meteors.'),\n",

APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES In accordance with paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO1”) and without prejudice to Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has been guided by ICSID Arbitration Rule 37 in evaluating the Parties’ requests (including their objections and replies).'),\n",

       "   'The Tribunal has carefully considered each of the requests, objections and replies made by the Parties as set out in their respective schedules. The Tribunal’s decision on each individual request is set out in the last column of the Parties’ Redfern schedules. IV. THE TRIBUNAL’S GENERAL OBSERVATIONS For the avoidance of doubt, the term “document” has the meaning of a writing, communication, picture, drawing, program or data of any kind, whether recorded or maintained on paper or by electronic, audio, visual or any other means. Where ordered to do so, the Parties are required to produce documents that are within their possession, custody or control. Any document the production of which is ordered by the Tribunal shall be communicated within the time limit set out in the Procedural Timetable, directly to the requesting Party without copying the Tribunal. Documents produced voluntarily as well as those produced pursuant to this PO2, shall only form part of the record if and when they are submitted as exhibits to the main pleadings.'),\n",
       "  (2,\n",
       "   'Otherwise, they shall not be taken into account by the Tribunal. The Parties must undertake reasonable searches in relation to the requests that have been granted or voluntarily complied with. Any search that has already been undertaken by a Party does not need to be carried out again, provided that such search was reasonable. The Tribunal directs that where a party wishes to assert privilege, legal impediment or confidentiality over a responsive document that it has been ordered to produce (or as otherwise directed by the Tribunal), it should record that document in a privilege and confidentiality log to be provided to the other side. The Parties must produce any privilege and confidentiality logs at the latest on the 15 June 2024. V. DECISION In light of the above, after having carefully considered the assertions made by the Parties and taking into account the applicable principles, the Tribunal unanimously: \\ni. DECIDES on the Parties’ requests as set out in the Redfern schedules that are attached to this PO2 as annexes A and annex B, subject to the Parties applying the agreed and reasonable search terms and date ranges as ordered above.'),\n",

ORDERS each Party to produce the documents pertaining to each of the requests that have been fully or partially granted by 15 June 2024 at the latest. Each Party that wishes to assert that any of the documents to be disclosed or part thereof is privileged, subject to legal impediment or confidential, to file a privilege and confidentiality log in accordance with the general guidelines above.

       "   'Astracommex submits that Astracommex was not liable for the collision. Celestria used the incident to initiate an investigation against Astracommex and to suspend the operation of satellites. This move was discriminatory because no investigation and suspension of operations was issued for Valinor. The requested documents are relevant to assess whether the behavior of the Department of Defense was non-discriminatory and justified. Celestria objects to the request for the following reasons: • Complying with the request is likely to entail data protection issues. As Valinor is in a long-term partnership with Celestria’s military, the search will likely entail data protection issues. Celestria should not have to incur such a risk. The request is unreasonably burdensome. The request should be dismissed because of the overwhelming likelihood that requested documents will be privileged or confidential. Celestria should not be required to incur the costs and efforts to look for and log such documents.'),\n",

       "   'Astracommex maintains the request and respectfully applies to the Tribunal to order the production of responsive documents. • Celestria failed to specify and substantiate the alleged “data protection issues.” Celestria did not even attempt to conduct a reasonable search and only speculates that such search would “likely entail” unspecified “data protection issues.” This objection is therefore too unspecific for Astracommex to respond to. The request is reasonable in its scope and is not burdensome. Celestria again only “expects” the search to be burdensome, without providing any reason. Moreover, the request is not more burdensome than any other document production request. The Request relates to matters potentially relevant to this arbitration and is granted, unless said documents are privileged or confidential under PO2.
